 Essentially, last week I figured out how to make all the game tables appear to me. However, I had only mastered calling 1 table into R. 
```{r gather from last time}
mens_olympic_url_print<- paste0("https://results.worldcurling.org/Championship/DisplayResults?tournamentId=560&associationId=0&teamNumber=0&drawNumber=0")
games2<-read_html(mens_olympic_url_print)
# this time I piped games2 into div and then table to get past the div barrier. 
games_tab2 <- games2 %>% 
  html_nodes("div") %>%
  html_nodes("table")

# Here, games_tab is a list of html nodes that contain "div" and then "table", singling out all of the results of the games.

single_game <- games_tab2[[1]] %>% html_table(header = T, fill = T) %>% clean_names()
single_game
names<- colnames(single_game)
# Here, single_game is turning a single game from my list of games into a tibble. I need to make this work for ALL the games in the doc

```
```{r looped call}
# going to maken empty tibble to later fill in a for loop
mens_test <- tibble()
# this defines x as having the correct setup but no data
x<- single_game %>%  slice(0)
# this for loop fills x every time with a new game from the games_tab list of
# html nodes

for(i in 1: length(games_tab2)) {
  # i is length of games_tab so that it iterates through each
 x <- games_tab2[[i]] %>% 
   # html_table is the function that turns the node into a table
    html_table(header = F, fill = T) %>%
   # this is kinda hacky. I turned header to F so that it fills the column names
   # into the first row, then using slice I isolate the second and third rows,
   # which are the actual data. this produces some amoung of waste since I'm not
   # ignoring the first row as much as I am simply slicing it out after wards,
   # but this is the best I could come up with.
  slice(2:3) 
 mens_test<- rbind(mens_test, x)
 # using rbind I add x to my ever-growing mens_test tibble. 
}
# setting up a vector of actual column names
names<- colnames(single_game)
names <- c(names, "id")
# adding id at the end

mens_test <- mens_test %>% 
  # this mutate call makes some assumptions: it assumes that the for loop worked
  # perfectly and put all the rows into mens_test in perfect order, then this
  # overlays an identifier on top, which goes "1 , 1 , 2, 2..." etc all the way
  # down.
  mutate(id = rep(1:length(games_tab2), each = 2)) %>% 
  `colnames<-`(names)


```

```{r function make}
 # the goal here is to make what I just called above into a function that I
 # merely have to paste the url into. I think I'll start by making that function

womens_olympic_url<-paste0("https://results.worldcurling.org/Championship/DisplayResults?tournamentId=561&associationId=0&teamNumber=0&drawNumber=0")

load_html_list<- function(url) {
  games2<-read_html(url)
  games_tab2 <- games2 %>% 
  html_nodes("div") %>%
  html_nodes("table")
  games_tab2
}
womens_olympic_html<-load_html_list(womens_olympic_url)

get_clean_results<- function(html_list) {
  test<- tibble()
  y<- single_game %>%  slice(0)
  for(i in 1: length(html_list)) {
    x <- html_list[[i]] %>% 
      html_table(header = F, fill = T) %>%
      slice(2:3)
    test<- rbind(test, x)
    }
  names<- colnames(single_game)
  names <- c(names, "id")
  test <- test %>% 
  mutate(id = rep(1:length(html_list), each = 2)) %>% 
  `colnames<-`(names)
  test
}

womens_olympic_results<- get_clean_results(womens_olympic_html) %>% mutate(competition = "olympic_women")
mens_olympic_results<- mens_test %>% mutate(competition = "olympic_men")

#html processing function needs to have an argument for the printurl, which I
#think I'll define outside of the function using paste0 because I don't want to
#mess with putting a long url into a function call.

```

```{r putting olympic men and women together}
olympics<- rbind(womens_olympic_results, mens_olympic_results)
olympics<- olympics %>% 
  rename(country= draw_number_1_2, 
         hammer = draw_number_1_3)
olympics %>% 
  group_by(competition, id, country) %>% 
  mutate(first_end_winner = case_when(
                            x1[1]>x1[2] ~ T,
                            x1[1]<x1[2] ~ F,
                            x1[1]==x1[2] ~ F
                            )  )%>% 
  view()
```
