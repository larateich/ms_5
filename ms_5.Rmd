 Essentially,  last week I mastered calling game tables into R. This week, I called men's and Women's olympic games into R, added some indicator variables, and got this preliminary estimate on the number of games that were won by the same team in the first end as in total. However, I removed ties from my analysis, which I won't do in the final version. 
```{r gather from last time}
mens_olympic_url_print<- paste0("https://results.worldcurling.org/Championship/DisplayResults?tournamentId=560&associationId=0&teamNumber=0&drawNumber=0")
games2<-read_html(mens_olympic_url_print)
# this time I piped games2 into div and then table to get past the div barrier. 
games_tab2 <- games2 %>% 
  html_nodes("div") %>%
  html_nodes("table")

# Here, games_tab is a list of html nodes that contain "div" and then "table", singling out all of the results of the games.

single_game <- games_tab2[[1]] %>% html_table(header = T, fill = T) %>% clean_names()
names<- colnames(single_game)
# Here, single_game is turning a single game from my list of games into a tibble. I need to make this work for ALL the games in the doc

```
```{r looped call}
# going to maken empty tibble to later fill in a for loop
mens_test <- tibble()
# this defines x as having the correct setup but no data
x<- single_game %>%  slice(0)
# this for loop fills x every time with a new game from the games_tab list of
# html nodes

for(i in 1: length(games_tab2)) {
  # i is length of games_tab so that it iterates through each
 x <- games_tab2[[i]] %>% 
   # html_table is the function that turns the node into a table
    html_table(header = F, fill = T) %>%
   # this is kinda hacky. I turned header to F so that it fills the column names
   # into the first row, then using slice I isolate the second and third rows,
   # which are the actual data. this produces some amoung of waste since I'm not
   # ignoring the first row as much as I am simply slicing it out after wards,
   # but this is the best I could come up with.
  slice(2:3) 
 mens_test<- rbind(mens_test, x)
 # using rbind I add x to my ever-growing mens_test tibble. 
}
# setting up a vector of actual column names
names<- colnames(single_game)
names <- c(names, "id")
# adding id at the end

mens_test <- mens_test %>% 
  # this mutate call makes some assumptions: it assumes that the for loop worked
  # perfectly and put all the rows into mens_test in perfect order, then this
  # overlays an identifier on top, which goes "1 , 1 , 2, 2..." etc all the way
  # down.
  mutate(id = rep(1:length(games_tab2), each = 2)) %>% 
  `colnames<-`(names)


```

```{r function make}
 # the goal here is to make what I just called above into a function that I
 # merely have to paste the url into. I think I'll start by making that function

womens_olympic_url<-paste0("https://results.worldcurling.org/Championship/DisplayResults?tournamentId=561&associationId=0&teamNumber=0&drawNumber=0")

load_html_list<- function(url) {
  games2<-read_html(url)
  games_tab2 <- games2 %>% 
  html_nodes("div") %>%
  html_nodes("table")
  games_tab2
}
womens_olympic_html<-load_html_list(womens_olympic_url)

get_clean_results<- function(html_list) {
  test<- tibble()
  y<- single_game %>%  slice(0)
  for(i in 1: length(html_list)) {
    x <- html_list[[i]] %>% 
      html_table(header = F, fill = T) %>%
      slice(2:3)
    test<- rbind(test, x)
    }
  names<- colnames(single_game)
  names <- c(names, "id")
  test <- test %>% 
  mutate(id = rep(1:length(html_list), each = 2)) %>% 
  `colnames<-`(names)
  test
}

womens_olympic_results<- get_clean_results(womens_olympic_html) %>% mutate(competition = "olympic_women")
mens_olympic_results<- mens_test %>% mutate(competition = "olympic_men")

#html processing function needs to have an argument for the printurl, which I
#think I'll define outside of the function using paste0 because I don't want to
#mess with putting a long url into a function call.
